# BOTC Script PDF Generator

Extremely basic utility which uses the new script tool to quickly generate default-setting PDFs.

## Usage

Run `npm i`, then:

```sh
npm start [script link]
```

You can get the script link from the export menu in the script tool.

## TODO

- [ ] Add settings & potentially CSS injection
